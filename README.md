# Frontend Layouts & Components Collection

This repository contains a collection of small, focused UI layouts and components built using:

- **HTML**
- **CSS**
- **JavaScript** (future)
- **React** (future)
- **Flutter** (future)

Each layout or component is stored in its own folder with:

- A working demo (`index.html` / React component / Flutter widget)
- Styles (`styles.css` or component-level styles)
- 1–2 screenshots (mobile + desktop)
- A README describing that specific layout

The purpose of this repo is to track my growth as I move from **basic frontend** to **intermediate** and then to **advanced frameworks**.
